| MaskLLM: Learnable Semi-Structured Sparsity for Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17481) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17481))| wxcTest, gheinrich, srvm, yinhongxu, Vinnnf | The authors present MaskLLM, a novel method for achieving semi-structured (N:M) sparsity in Large Language Models (LLMs) by formulating mask selection as a differentiable sampling process using Gumbel Softmax.  This approach enables end-to-end training of sparsity masks on large-scale datasets, leading to superior performance compared to traditional one-shot pruning techniques. Experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA-2 and GPT-3 variants, demonstrate that MaskLLM achieves state-of-the-art perplexity scores while enabling significant memory and computational savings.  Notably, MaskLLM facilitates lossless compression for specific downstream tasks by learning specialized masks, and the authors introduce "Mask Prior," a technique for efficient transfer learning of sparsity. This work holds significant practical implications for AI practitioners, offering a pathway to deploy more efficient and scalable LLMs in real-world applications with reduced resource requirements.   |

This is achieved by introducing "3D Patches," a representation that augments 2D image patch features with 3D positional embeddings, allowing LLaVA-3D to process and understand 3D scenes from multi-view images. Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on various 3D benchmarks, including 3D question answering, captioning, and visual grounding, while maintaining strong 2D image understanding capabilities. This development presents a significant advancement for AI practitioners, particularly AI engineers and data scientists working with 3D vision and language tasks, by offering a practical and efficient method to empower LMMs with 3D-awareness. LLaVA-3D's ability to perform complex 3D scene understanding tasks, along with its ease of use and integration with existing 2D models, makes it a valuable tool for developing applications in fields such as robotics, virtual reality, and augmented reality.   |
| EMOVA: Empowering Language Models to See, Hear and Speak with Vivid Emotions (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18042) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.18042))| vikyzeng2, 17day, zhili-liu, gyhdog, KaiChen1998 | This research paper presents EMOVA, an innovative omni-modal large language model that leverages a continuous vision encoder and a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer to enable simultaneous alignment of visual, speech, and text modalities. The model employs a novel text-centric alignment strategy that uses text as a bridge to facilitate alignment without relying on scarce omni-modal image-text-speech data. This joint optimization method not only enhances vision-language and speech capabilities but also surpasses corresponding bi-modal counterparts. Remarkably, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both vision-language and speech benchmarks while supporting spoken dialogue with controllable emotional expressions.  For AI practitioners, EMOVA offers a robust framework for building omni-modal applications with real-time spoken dialogue and emotion control, paving the way for more versatile and expressive human-computer interactions.   |
| Lotus: Diffusion-based Visual Foundation Model for High-quality Dense Prediction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18124) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.18124))| Leheng Li, Yixun Liang, Wei Yin, Jing He, haodongli | This research introduces Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model for enhancing dense prediction tasks like depth and normal estimation. The authors identify limitations in existing diffusion models when applied to dense prediction, proposing a novel adaptation protocol that addresses these issues. By incorporating a single-step diffusion process and a "detail preserver", Lotus achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot depth and normal estimation tasks, surpassing previous models in accuracy and efficiency. This development is particularly relevant for AI practitioners working with limited data, as Lotus demonstrates superior performance with significantly less training data compared to other state-of-the-art models.  This advancement allows for wider adoption and potential for practical applications like 3D reconstruction and robotics.   |
| Discovering the Gems in Early Layers: Accelerating Long-Context LLMs with 1000x Input Token Reduction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17422) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17422))| Shafiq Joty, Yingyu Liang, Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Zhenmei Shi, alvinming | The research presents GemFilter, a novel inference strategy to accelerate Large Language Model (LLM) inference with long context inputs, effectively addressing the bottleneck of high computational cost and latency. GemFilter leverages the observation that relevant information for a query is often identified within the early layers of an LLM. By using these early layers as filters, GemFilter selects and compresses input tokens, leading to a significant reduction in context length for subsequent LLM processing. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GemFilter achieves a 2.4x speedup and a 30% reduction in GPU memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art methods. This approach offers a practical solution for AI engineers and data scientists to deploy and optimize LLMs for long-context tasks, especially when computational resources are limited.   |
| Pixel-Space Post-Training of Latent Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17565) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17565))| Felix Juefei-Xu, Ji Hou, Matthew Yu, Simran Motwani, Christina Zhang | This research paper proposes a novel approach to improve the quality of images generated by Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) by incorporating a pixel-space loss function during the post-training phase. The authors argue that operating solely in the compressed latent space, as is typical for LDMs, can lead to loss of detail and artifacts in the generated images. By adding a pixel-space objective during fine-tuning, either supervised or preference-based, the model learns to better preserve high-frequency details, resulting in significantly enhanced visual quality and fewer flaws in the generated images. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on both DiT and U-Net based LDMs, showing significant improvements in visual appeal and reduction of visual flaws without compromising text alignment. This technique provides AI practitioners, particularly those working with image generation, a simple yet effective method to enhance the quality of images generated by LDMs without architectural modifications, potentially leading to higher fidelity and more realistic image synthesis.   |
| Reducing the Footprint of Multi-Vector Retrieval with Minimal Performance Impact via Token Pooling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14683) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.14683))| Griffin Adams, Antoine Chaffin, Benjamin Clavié | This paper introduces TOKEN POOLING, a straightforward method to compress multi-vector retrieval models like ColBERT by clustering and averaging similar token representations.  Evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that this approach can reduce the index size by 50% with negligible impact on retrieval performance, and up to 66% with minimal degradation. Notably, TOKEN POOLING seamlessly integrates with ColBERT's quantization pipeline, further enhancing compression capabilities. This method is particularly relevant for practitioners working with large-scale retrieval systems, as it offers a practical means to substantially reduce storage and memory footprints without compromising accuracy. This is especially important for deployments where resource constraints are a concern, or when utilizing indexing methods that offer greater flexibility for data updates compared to those typically employed with large multi-vector indexes.   |
| Disco4D: Disentangled 4D Human Generation and Animation from a Single Image (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17280) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17280))| Tianwei Zhang, Lei Yang, Zhongang Cai, Shuai Liu, Hui En Pang | Disco4D is a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that generates and animates 3D clothed human avatars from a single image. Disco4D separates the human body and clothing into distinct Gaussian models, leveraging the strengths of SMPL-X for body representation and Gaussian models for clothing variability. The framework uses diffusion models for 3D reconstruction enhancement, addressing the challenge of occluded parts.  Disco4D outperforms existing methods in fidelity, disentanglement, and animation quality, evidenced by quantitative and qualitative benchmarks on standard datasets. Its ability to disentangle and manipulate clothing assets while maintaining high-fidelity 3D representation holds significant potential for various applications, including virtual try-on, avatar customization, and digital content creation. Practitioners working in these domains may find Disco4D to be a valuable tool for streamlining their workflows and enhancing the realism and customizability of their projects.  |
| Robot See Robot Do: Imitating Articulated Object Manipulation with Monocular 4D Reconstruction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18121) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.18121))| Qianqian Wang, Brent Yi, Mingxuan Wu, Chung Min Kim, Justin Kerr | The authors propose a novel method, Robot See Robot Do (RSRD), to enable a robot to imitate articulated object manipulation from a single monocular video. The system leverages 4D Differentiable Part Models (4D-DPM) for 3D part motion recovery from monocular video and plans bimanual arm motions to induce the demonstrated object part motion. RSRD achieves an average of 87% success rate in each phase and 60% end-to-end success rate across 90 trials on 9 objects. This work demonstrates the viability of using pretrained vision models, without any task-specific training, to learn new manipulation skills for a robot. This could be a valuable tool for AI engineers and Data Scientists working on robotics applications to simplify the process of teaching new manipulation skills to robots.   |
| Instruction Following without Instruction Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14254) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.14254))| Christopher D. Manning, Percy Liang, Nelson F. Liu, John Hewitt | This research paper investigates instruction following in language models without explicit instruction tuning. The authors identify two implicit instruction tuning approaches: response tuning (training on responses only) and single-task fine-tuning (training on a narrow domain). Surprisingly, both approaches yield models capable of following general instructions, even surpassing base models in performance.  This suggests that instruction-response mappings might be implicitly learned during pretraining, and seemingly unrelated fine-tuning tasks can implicitly enhance instruction-following capabilities.  This finding holds practical relevance for practitioners, emphasizing the need for comprehensive testing and safety evaluations even for models fine-tuned for specific tasks, as they may exhibit unintended general instruction-following behavior.   |

Riegler, Cise Midoglu, Sushant Gautam, Zahra Sepasdar | This paper presents Structured-GraphRAG, a novel framework designed to enhance information retrieval from structured datasets. Structured-GraphRAG leverages the power of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and graph-based architectures to provide more accurate and efficient retrieval of data from structured sources. Experimental results demonstrate that Structured-GraphRAG outperforms traditional methods by reducing processing time, enhancing answer accuracy, and mitigating the issue of hallucinations in Language Models (LLMs). By offering a more accessible approach to KG construction, Structured-GraphRAG proves to be a valuable tool for AI engineers and data scientists working with structured data across diverse domains.   |
