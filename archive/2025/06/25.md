| Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic
  Empirical Study (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19794) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.19794))| Ziheng Zhang, Jintian Zhang, Yi Zhong, Yuqi Zhu, Ningyu | Open-source LLMs underperform in data analysis tasks compared to proprietary models. The paper investigates methods to improve open-source LLMs for reasoning-intensive data analysis scenarios. The study evaluates models across data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning using a curated dataset. Strategic planning quality is identified as the primary determinant of model performance; high-quality training data proves more critical than data diversity for optimal performance; fine-tuning a 7B model with data synthesis methodology achieved comparable or superior results to GPT-4o, with the 14B model's gains diminished at larger scale. The findings imply that improvements to reasoning processes within data synthesis can significantly enhance the analytical capabilities of open-source LLMs, directly benefiting AI practitioners by enabling more effective use of smaller LLMs for complex data analysis.  |
