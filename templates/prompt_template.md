    - Natural Language Processing
    - Computer Vision
    - Reinforcement Learning
    - Machine Learning
    - Multi-Modal
    - Other
- Output only the exact category name with no additional formatting or text.

Summary:
- Write a summary in 4-5 concise sentences covering:
    i. A one-line overall summary.
